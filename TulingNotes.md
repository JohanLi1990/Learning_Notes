# Tuling Notes

## 全面理解JVM

- How is Java program executed. (tools: UltraEdit for byte code, jclasslib for analysis and understanding). Java execution has to abide Java Language Specification
  
- Class loading mechanism (sandbox protection, cache + parent + bootstrap loader)
  - bytecode, exception table, miscellanous
![JVM架构图](image.png)

- Garbage Collection (tools: arthas for diagnostic)
  - Java opts, -, -X, -XX
  - default collector G1, 
  - print and analyze GC logs

- Notable interview question 
  - Where is `this` stored in JVM? 
  - Why tomcat could do hot reload for jsp, but not for jar?
  - Why do we need custom class loader? how is it implement (by overriding loadClass method in ClassLoader)
  - Why cannot child class override static method from main class (invokevirtual vs invokestatic in JLS)

## 类加载机制实在（升值加薪之旅）2025-09-17
- JDK8 classloading summary:
  - Classloading cache (in native methods)
  - Parents delegations: upward delegations, downward loading
  - domain protection (sanbox protection) : `preDefineClass` method in `ClassLoader.java`

- Linking process (the subtle native `resolveClass` method in `ClassLoader.java`)
  - Verfication: is the bytecode aligned with JLS, is there CAFEBABE? is there any children of final class, which is forbidden etc
  - Preparation: setting up memory for static fields of a class, and assign default value.
  - Resolution:
    - Purpose: Replace symbolic references in the constant pool with direct references.
    - Symbolic references are strings like "java/lang/Object" or "doSomething:()V".
    - Resolution turns these into actual pointers (to Class objects, method table entries, field offsets). Done lazily in some JVMs: the JVM spec allows resolution to happen at use time, not strictly during linking. 
- 实战
  - `OADemo2.java`: use URLCalssLoader to load jar from remote web server or file directory
  - `OADemo3.java`: Customized ClassLoader + ByteCode Obfuscation
  - `OADemo5.java`: Hot reloading of Class: create a new Classloader instance everytime you calculate salary. Performance not good, huge GC burden.
  - `OADemo6.java`: Customized ClassLoader still delegates class loading to AppClassLoader, and if there is a SalaryCaler class under the current src directory, src/SalaryCaler.java will be loaded before our custom jar from another directory. We need to break the parent delegation and prioritize loading with the current file from jar. 
  - `OADemo9.java`: Use JDK SPI and Spring Boot SPI to return services implementations for use, dynamically, without reflection.
    - Note that for **Any** Custom ClassLoader, if you call `super.loadClass()`, you will inevitably trigger the default Parents Delegations in JDK, so all services in current directory that matches your class fullname will get loaded.

## JVM内存模型深度剖析与优化 (JVM model Deep Analysis) 2025-09-18
- JVM Model: 
  ![JVM Model](JVM_model.png)

- Runtime Data Areas: PC, Method Area (MetaSpace), Heap, Stack, Native Method Stack
- For each method call there will be Stack Frame:
  - For each frame contains:
    - Local Variables (primitive types, object references)
    - Operand Stack (for intermediate calculations)
    - Frame Data (method return address, etc)
    - Dynamic Linking (reference to the runtime constant pool)
- JVM options:
  - Standard options, `java -h`
  - Non-standard options, `java -X`
  - Advanced options, `java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal`
- Notable JVM applications in Spring Boot:
  - Tomcat/catalina.sh: 
  ```java
    java ‐Xms2048M ‐Xmx2048M ‐Xmn1024M ‐Xss512K ‐XX:MetaspaceSize=256M ‐XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256M ‐jar microservice‐eureka‐server.jar
  ```
  we fix the size of `MetaspaceSize` and `MaxMetaspaceSize` to avoid dynamic expansion of metaspace, to avoid full GC pauses.

- Notable Intervew Questions: Why do we need to do STW? why can't we do GC while application is running?
  - Answer: we cannot becuase during GC, objects may be moved, if the object marked for moving is no longer needed (because app is running at the same time), we are wasting resource moving them to old generation. Also, if we are moving objects while app is running, the app may be accessing the object at the same time, leading to data inconsistency.
- Tools: jstat, jmap, jstack, jinfo, jcmd, VisualVM, VisualGC, Mission Control, et

## JVM对象创建与内存分配机制深度剖析 2025-09-19

- This lesson deepdives into JVM, and even analyzes how certain process are called in C++ code in HotSpot JVM.
- Metaspace (JDK8+), PermGen (JDK7 and below)
  - Class metadata, static variables, constants
  - Metaspace is allocated in native memory, not in heap memory
  - Default size is 21MB, can be adjusted with `-XX:MetaspaceSize` and `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize`, it is best practice to set both to the same value to avoid dynamic expansion
  - When metaspace is full, it will trigger a full GC to reclaim space
  - Common issues: `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`, can be solved by increasing metaspace size or reducing class loading/unloading
- During production, based your business load, you can actually calculate the required JVM memory size, and set the JVM options accordingly.
  - For example, if you have 300 orders/sec, that could amount to 300kb/sec in object creations, 
  - There are other things that comes with the order (coupons, stocks etc) so lets amplify by 20 , 200 * 300kb/sec,
  - if there are other order queries, we might amplify by another 10 times, 10 * 200 * 300kb/sec = 60 MB/sec
  - However those orders are short lived orders, if we do this `-Xmn2048m` so we increase the young gen to 2G, we can reduce full gc
- JVM object creations:
  - class loading
  - memory allocation
  - initialization
  - set object header
  - run init method
- Notable concepts: 
  - Pointer Compression (default in 64bit JVM, actually just left shift by 3 bits so we can reduce memory footprint), TLAB (Thread Local Allocation Buffer),
  - JVM Stack allocation, escape analysis: stack allocation, scalar replacement, lock elision
This lesson is very hardcore, there are alot of useful informations. Lesson 3 and lesson 4 are worth revisiting.
